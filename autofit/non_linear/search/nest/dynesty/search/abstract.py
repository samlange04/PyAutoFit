        Fit a model using the search and the Analysis class which contains the data and returns the log likelihood from
        instances of the model, which the `NonLinearSearch` seeks to maximize.

        A multiprocessing pool is built only when `number_of_cores > 1`. At `number_of_cores=1` the search runs
        fully serially with no pool, because a `Pool(1)` forces every likelihood call through a forked worker,
        which deadlocks in XLA compilation when the likelihood touches JAX and hangs forever if that worker dies
        (the same fix Nautilus received in #1442 / #1443; see #1630). Consequently, a run started with
        `number_of_cores=1` cannot be resumed with more cores (`check_pool` raises a `SearchException`), exactly
        as on the existing `force_x1_cpu` path.

        However, certain operating systems (e.g. Windows) do not support Python multiprocessing particularly well.
        This can cause Dynesty to crash when a pool is included. If this occurs (raising a `RunTimeException`)
        a Dynesty object without a pool is created and used instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            The model which generates instances for different points in parameter space.
        analysis
            Contains the data and the log likelihood function which fits an instance of the model to the data,
            returning the log likelihood dynesty maximizes.

        Returns
        -------
        A result object comprising the Samples object that includes the maximum log likelihood instance and full
        set of accepted samples of the fit.

        1. No output paths (`NullPaths`): there are no on-the-fly updates, so one pass is always final.
        2. The global `maxcall` has been reached.
        3. Dynesty stopped itself inside the budget (`chunk_is_finished`). The two samplers count `maxcall`
           differently, so the budget handed to `run_nested` (`maxcall_from`) and this criterion are
           per-sampler:

           - The static sampler's per-run call counter resets on every `run_nested` call and it stops on the
             budget only once that counter is *strictly above* `maxcall`, while `sum(results.ncall)` grows by
             at least that counter. So `maxcall` is the per-chunk increment, and a pass that added no more
             calls than its budget stopped on dynesty's own termination criterion (`dlogz`, `maxiter`, ...).
           - The dynamic sampler compares `maxcall` against its *cumulative* call count (`self.ncall` carried
             over from previous `run_nested` calls). Handing it the per-chunk increment again on the second
             chunk is a budget it has already spent, so it returns without sampling, criterion 4 fires and a
             truncated baseline run is returned as the result. Nor can a baseline run that `maxcall` cut
             short be continued (the next call restarts it, and `resume=True` refuses after `RUN_DONE`).
             `DynestyDynamic` therefore runs the whole baseline in the first chunk (`maxbatch=0`, no budget),
             then chunks the batch phase by cumulative budget `total_iterations + iterations`, and a batch
             chunk is finished only when it stopped strictly inside that budget. See `DynestyDynamic.chunk_kwargs`.

           Under the default `iterations_per_full_update` (1e99) every converged run is finished in a single
           pass for both samplers, with no intermediate `perform_update`, checkpoint restore or second no-op
           `run_nested`.
        4. Legacy criterion: the pass performed no new likelihood calls (e.g. re-running an already converged
           sampler restored from its checkpoint).

        A pass that exhausted its budget (a finite `iterations_per_full_update` chunk) is not finished, so the
        search loops through `perform_update` and runs the next chunk.

        Parameters
        ----------
        search_internal
            The Dynesty sampler (static or dynamic) which is run and performs nested sampling.

        Returns
        -------
        True if the search is finished, False if another `run_nested` chunk is required.
